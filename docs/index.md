This is the tutorial page for the **GenRiskPro platform**, single-sample web-server version of  **GenRiskPro**, and two other extra web-server interface **BabySeqPro** and **OncoRiskPro**.


## Platform Overview

GenRiskPro is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline end-to-end whole genome sequencing (WGS) data processing, variant prioritization and interpretation, and personalized reporting of clinical and wellness findings to sequenced individuals. By facilitating collaborative engagement among hospitals, clinicians, genomic research facilities, and patients through this cloud-based platform, it directly supports the implementation of precision medicine across diverse populations. Thus, the platform represents a significant step toward digital health for each individual by integrating their genomic data into actionable outcomes.
Currently, the platform has already been used to generate genomic reports for over 1,000 individuals under the supervision of genetic counsellors, with the number of beneficiaries continuing to grow daily. Through these reports, individuals have received personalized assessments of genetic disease risk and corresponding medical guidance — including for newborns and pregnant women. GenRiskPro is actively utilized not only in the initial data collection phase but also for ongoing analysis of datasets from the Anatolian Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI).

Despite significant advances in WGS technology, clinical adoption remains limited. Many large-scale genomic projects accumulate vast amounts of data yet fail to return actionable results to individuals who could benefit. GenRiskPro addresses this critical gap through three key innovations:
- (1) GenRiskDB, a comprehensive database that systematically integrates 14 established resources with variant-level, gene-level, and phenotype-level annotations to support both clinical and wellness reporting;
- (2) an advanced web portal that enables both clinical and research use through bulk VCF processing, interactive variant filtering, dynamic in-house allele frequency calculation, and customizable report generation; and
- (3) a mobile application connected to the web portal, featuring LongevityAI, a fine-tuned language model designed for patient-friendly genomic communication.

GenRiskDB supports exportable, comprehensive genomic reporting across four categories: clinical risk variants, pharmacogenomic variants, GWAS variants, and lifestyle-trait variants. The web portal’s two-tiered reporting system balances automation with clinical oversight, enabling refined variant curation prior to patient delivery. The mobile application empowers individuals to better understand their genetic data and make informed health decisions, while preserving professional clinical supervision.
