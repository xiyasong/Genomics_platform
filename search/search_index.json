By facilitating collaborative engagement among hospitals, clinicians, genomic research facilities, and patients through this cloud-based platform, it directly supports the implementation of precision medicine across diverse populations. Thus, the platform represents a significant step toward digital health for each individual by integrating their genomic data into actionable outcomes. Currently, the platform has already been used to generate genomic reports for over 1,000 individuals under the supervision of genetic counsellors, with the number of beneficiaries continuing to grow daily. Through these reports, individuals have received personalized assessments of genetic disease risk and corresponding medical guidance \u2014 including for newborns and pregnant women. GenRiskPro is actively utilized not only in the initial data collection phase but also for ongoing analysis of datasets from the Anatolian Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI).</p> <p>Despite significant advances in WGS technology, clinical adoption remains limited. Many large-scale genomic projects accumulate vast amounts of data yet fail to return actionable results to individuals who could benefit. GenRiskPro addresses this critical gap through three key innovations: - (1) GenRiskDB, a comprehensive database that systematically integrates 14 established resources with variant-level, gene-level, and phenotype-level annotations to support both clinical and wellness reporting; - (2) an advanced web portal that enables both clinical and research use through bulk VCF processing, interactive variant filtering, dynamic in-house allele frequency calculation, and customizable report generation; and - (3) a mobile application connected to the web portal, featuring LongevityAI, a fine-tuned language model designed for patient-friendly genomic communication.</p> <p>GenRiskDB supports exportable, comprehensive genomic reporting across four categories: clinical risk variants, pharmacogenomic variants, GWAS variants, and lifestyle-trait variants. The web portal\u2019s two-tiered reporting system balances automation with clinical oversight, enabling refined variant curation prior to patient delivery. The mobile application empowers individuals to better understand their genetic data and make informed health decisions, while preserving professional clinical supervision.</p>"},{"location":"#table-of-contents","title":"Table of Contents","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Quick Start for GenRiskPro Platform (Cohort Analysis) Multi-sample/cohort-based analysis platform for research facilities and healthcare organizations</p> </li> <li> <p>Quick Start for GenRiskPro Web-server (Single Sample) Individual sample analysis using the web-based interface</p> </li> <li> <p>In-house Reference Panel Guidelines for using In-house reference panel to explore the allele frequencies of the new sequenced cohorts.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This documentation is regularly updated to reflect the latest features and improvements.</p>"},{"location":"GenRiskPro_Dashboard_tutorial/","title":"GenRiskPro Dashboard - Multi-Sample Platform Version","text":"<ul> <li>This is the platform version of GenRiskPro for multi-sample/cohort-based upload, management, analysis and reporting. </li> <li>The entry of GenRiskPro Dashboard now is integrated as \"XOmics Portal\", with the same address https://www.phenomeportal.org/dashboard</li> <li> <p>Compared to the web-server version, this platform is designed for research facilities, hospitals, and health organizations requiring cohort-based genomic management and reporting.</p> </li> <li> <p>The specific features including a full glance of all data inside the cohort (including the TR and SW).</p> </li> <li> <p>In this platform dashboard, the TR and SW cohort is linked to the mobile app as one of features of LongevityCloud.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Development Status: This platform is currently in development for multi-omics capabilities.

The analysis begins with standard variant call format (VCF) files and employs curated gene panels from established NGS screening projects, with flexibility for user-defined panels. The server generates detailed variant annotations by leveraging extensively validated databases and computational tools. Outputs include prioritized clinically relevant variants with comprehensive annotations of pathogenicity, population frequencies, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic associations. The system incorporates established resources to provide broader insights, including GWAS-derived phenotypic associations, evidence-based wellness and trait information across 15 complex trait categories, and pharmacogenetic annotations from PharmGKB with validated genotype-phenotype correlations. GenRiskPro implements standard statistical methods for population-level analysis to calculate allele frequencies, as demonstrated through analysis of whole genome sequencing data from Turkish (n=275) and Swedish (n=101) cohorts. This integrated platform will be particularly valuable for clinical laboratories, genetic counsellors, and researchers requiring standardized variant interpretation and reporting workflows based on established genomic resources.
