Gene panel curation integrates authoritative sources, including the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) and seven international NBSeq initiatives (Betzler et al., 2024), ensuring comprehensive coverage of clinical practice. The server processes input in variant call format (VCF) files, which contain single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (INDELs), or structural variants (SVs) using industry-standard annotation tools and databases. Our implementation leverages established clinical genomics resources for variant interpretation, including OMIM (Amberger et al., 2015), ClinVar (Landrum et al., 2014), and GWAS Catalogue (Sollis et al., 2023), while incorporating validated pharmacogenomic databases (Whirl-Carrillo et al., 2021) for paediatric medication guidance.

The platform systematically applies the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) variant classification criteria by integrating widely validated genomic resources, including ClinVar(1), OMIM(2), PharmGKB(3), and the GWAS Catalog(4). The analysis begins with standard variant call format (VCF) files and employs curated gene panels from established NGS screening projects, with flexibility for user-defined panels. The server generates detailed variant annotations by leveraging extensively validated databases and computational tools. Outputs include prioritized clinically relevant variants with comprehensive annotations of pathogenicity, population frequencies, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic associations. The system incorporates established resources to provide broader insights, including GWAS-derived phenotypic associations, evidence-based wellness and trait information across 15 complex trait categories, and pharmacogenetic annotations from PharmGKB with validated genotype-phenotype correlations. GenRiskPro implements standard statistical methods for population-level analysis to calculate allele frequencies, as demonstrated through analysis of whole genome sequencing data from Turkish (n=275) and Swedish (n=101) cohorts. This integrated platform will be particularly valuable for clinical laboratories, genetic counsellors, and researchers requiring standardized variant interpretation and reporting workflows based on established genomic resources.
